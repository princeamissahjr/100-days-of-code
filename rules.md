# My Coding Journey Rules 📝

## 🚀 **Daily Commitment**
1. **Code for at least 1 hour every day**
2. **Push to GitHub daily** - no zero days
3. **Document progress** in track.md
4. **Learn → Build → Repeat** cycle

## 📚 **Learning Philosophy**
- **Build projects, not just tutorials**
- **Embrace struggle** - it means you're growing
- **Ask for help** after 15 minutes of trying
- **Review previous day's code** before starting new

## 🛠️ **Project Rules**
- **Start small, iterate often**
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Semantic HTML** always
- **Clean, readable code** over clever code

## 🔥 **Progress Rules**
- **Celebrate small wins** daily
- **Compare only to my past self**
- **No guilt for missed days** - just restart
- **Share progress** weekly

## ⏰ **Time Management**
- **Pomodoro technique**: 25 mins focus, 5 mins break
- **No multitasking** during coding sessions
- **Plan tomorrow's task** today

## 🎯 **Quality Standards**
```bash
# Before every commit:
- [ ] Code works as expected
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Meaningful commit messages
- [ ] Files properly organized
