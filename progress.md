# My Coding Journey Progress

## Day 1: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Project:** Personal About Me Page
**What I Learned:**
- HTML structure and semantics
- Basic CSS styling
- Box model (padding, margin, border)
- Centering content with CSS

**Thoughts:** Excited to start this journey! Built my first real page that represents my goals.

**Tomorrow's Goal:** Add more styling and maybe a photo!
