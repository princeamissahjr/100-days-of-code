Create variables for:

Your full name (string)
Your age (number)
Whether you are a student (boolean)
Create a variable for a value you don’t know yet (leave it undefined).

Create a variable that you set to null.

Use console.log() to print all these variables with clear labels.

<script>
    let fullName = "Pepzig Jnr";
    let age = 20;
    let isStudent = true;
    let unknown;
    let married = null;

   console.log("Full Name", fullName);
   console.log("Age", age);
   console.log("Student", isStudent);
   console.log("Dont know", unknown);
   console.log("Married?", married);
</script>
